# SEJFO Blender Extensions
### Requires Blender 4.2+
##### Blender 3.6 compatible versions will be added in the future.

## Sejfo Tool Suite
This is our general purpose extension with a set of tools focused on optimising scenes comprised by large SolidWorks assemblies.
In this suite you'll find tools for finding and selecting all objects that matches a specified dimension interval (very useful for finding all screws in the scene), 
as well as a tool that helps collecting selected items and hiding them from the viewport.
A tool to identify the most dense object is included as well. This tool will select the object with most verticies, aiding you in model optimisation.

A tool to help creating a clean model hierarchy in Visual Components is included.
